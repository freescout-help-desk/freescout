# ramsey/uuid Changelog

## 3.8.0

_Released: 2018-07-19_

  * Add support for determining MAC address on FreeBSD systems ([#212](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/212))
  * Add a polyfill for PHP ctype functions to support systems where the ctype functions are not part of the PHP build ([#223](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/223))
  * Improve validation to disallow UUIDs with a trailing newline character ([#225](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/225))
  * Add annotations for thrown exceptions for improved IDE hinting ([#232](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/232))
  * Improve documentation, testing, and project metadata (i.e. `.gitattributes`, etc.)

## 3.7.3

_Released: 2018-01-19_

  * In rare cases, when using `glob()` to find `/sys/class/net/*/address` files on Linux, `glob()` encountered errors, returning `false` instead of an empty array, causing `array_map()` to emit warnings since its second parameter was not an array; this release gracefully handles cases where `glob()` returns `false` [#203](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/issues/203)
  * Fixed an off-by-one error in `DefaultTimeGenerator` and switching to `random_int()` from `mt_rand()` for better random numbers [#206](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/206)

## 3.7.2

_Released: 2018-01-13_

  * On Linux, first check sysfs to determine node identifier; this provides a reliable way to identify the node on Docker images, etc. [#185](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/185)

## 3.7.1

_Released: 2017-09-22_

  * Use `random_bytes()` when generating random nodes
  * Set the multicast bit for random nodes, according to RFC 4122, ยง4.5, [#170](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/170), [#171](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/171), [#182](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/182)

## 3.7.0

_Released: 2017-08-04_

  * Add UUID version constants [#173](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/issues/173), [#177](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/177)
    * `Uuid::UUID_TYPE_TIME`
    * `Uuid::UUID_TYPE_IDENTIFIER`
    * `Uuid::UUID_TYPE_HASH_MD5`

  * Optimize UUID string decoding [#164](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/164)

## 3.6.0

_Released: 2017-03-18_

  * Add `InvalidUuidStringException`, thrown when attempting to decode an invalid string UUID; this does not introduce any BC issues, since the new exception inherits from the previously used `InvalidArgumentException` [#162](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/162)
  * Improve memory usage when generating large quantities of UUIDs (use `str_pad()` and `dechex()` instead of `sprintf()`) [#160](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/160)
  * Minor test and documentation updates

## 3.5.2

_Released: 2016-11-22_

  * Fixed issue where same UUIDs were not treated as equal with mixed case ([#131](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/issues/131), [#137](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/137)).
  * Test cleanup.

## 3.5.0

_Released: 2016-08-02_

  * Add `OrderedTimeCodec` to store UUID in an optimized way for InnoDB ([#117](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/issues/117), [#118](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/118)).
  * Fixed `RandomNodeProvider` to prevent invalid node generation ([#129](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/129)).
  * Cache failed attempt to retrieve system node to avoid multiple system calls ([#107](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/issues/107), [#121](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/121)).

  * Clean up code, tests, and documentation

## 3.0.0

_Released: 2015-09-28_

The 3.0.0 release represents a significant step for the ramsey/uuid library. While the simple and familiar API used in previous versions remains intact, this release provides greater flexibility to integrators, including the ability to inject your own number generators, UUID codecs, node and time providers, and more.

  * BREAK: The root namespace for this package has changed from "Rhumsaa" to "Ramsey." In most cases, simply making this change in your applications is the only upgrade path you will need. Everything else should work as expected.
  * BREAK: The UUID [Doctrine field type](http://doctrine-dbal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/types.html) has been moved to [ramsey/uuid-doctrine](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-doctrine).
  * BREAK: The `uuid` console application has been moved to [ramsey/uuid-console](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-console).
  * BREAK: The `Uuid::VERSION` package version constant has been removed.
  * See also the release notes for [3.0.0-alpha1][300-alpha1], [3.0.0-alpha2][300-alpha2], [3.0.0-alpha3][300-alpha3], and [3.0.0-beta1][300-beta1].

## 3.0.0-beta1

_Released: 2015-08-31_

  * Improve GUID support to ensure that:
    * On little endian (LE) architectures, the byte order of the first three fields is LE.
    * On big endian (BE) architectures, it is the same as a GUID.
    * String representation is always the same.
  * Fix exception message for `DegradedNumberConverter::fromHex()`.
  * Add Scrutinizer configuration to run code-quality builds through Scrutinizer.
  * Auto-fix Scrutinizer issues.
  * Fix support URLs in composer.json to point to the correct GitHub repository.

## 3.0.0-alpha3

_Released: 2015-07-28_

  * Time generator improvements:
    * Enabled use of custom TimeGenerator implementations.
      * BREAK: Removed now unnecessary `timeConverter` and `timeProvider` properties, setters, and getters in both `FeatureSet` and `UuidFactory` as those are now exclusively used by the default `TimeGenerator`.
      * Added a `setTimeGenerator` method on `UuidFactory` to override the default time generator.
    * Add option to enable `PeclUuidTimeGenerator` via `FeatureSet`.

## 3.0.0-alpha2

_Released: 2015-07-28_

  * BREAK: Removed `PeclUuidFactory` in favor of using pecl-uuid with generators.
  * NEW: Refactored time-based (version 1) UUIDs into a `TimeGeneratorInterface` to allow for other sources to generate version 1 UUIDs in this library.
  * NEW: Added `PeclUuidTimeGenerator` and `PeclUuidRandomGenerator` for creating version 1 or version 4 UUIDs using the pecl-uuid extension.
  * NEW: Add `RandomBytesGenerator` for use with PHP 7. ramsey/uuid will default to use this generator when running on PHP 7.
  * `RandomLibAdapter` now defaults to a medium-strength generator with [ircmaxell/random-lib](https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib). This is configurable, so other generator strengths may be used.
  * Migrated to the Travis CI container-based infrastructure for builds.
  * Documentation updates and corrections.

## 3.0.0-alpha1

_Released: 2015-07-16_

  * BREAK: The root namespace for this package has changed from "Rhumsaa" to "Ramsey." In most cases, simply making this change in your applications is the only upgrade path you will need. Everything else should work as expected.
  * BREAK: The UUID [Doctrine field type](http://doctrine-dbal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/types.html) has been moved to [ramsey/uuid-doctrine](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-doctrine).
  * BREAK: The `uuid` console application has been moved to [ramsey/uuid-console](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-console).
  * BREAK: The `Uuid::VERSION` package version constant has been removed.
  * NEW: The `Uuid` class is no longer marked as `final`. Everything is now based around interfaces and factories, allowing you to use this package as a base to implement other kinds of UUIDs with different dependencies.
  * NEW: Through setting dependencies on `UuidFactory` and/or extending `FeatureSet`, you may override any package defaults, injecting your own dependencies.
  * NEW: For random number generation, in addition to `OpenSslGenerator` (used if `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` is present) and the fallback `MtRandGenerator`, you may use the bundled `CombGenerator` for sequential UUIDs or the `RandomLibAdapter` if using [ircmaxell/random-lib](https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib).
  * NEW: In addition to the default UUID generation, this library also supports GUID generation by configuring a `FeatureSet` to use GUIDs.
  * NEW: While the interface to create UUIDs hasn't changed, if using this package on a 32-bit system, you will now receive an object of type `DegradedUuid` (which extends `Uuid`, which implements `UuidInterface`).
  * NEW: All UUIDs are now [JsonSerializable](http://php.net/JsonSerializable).

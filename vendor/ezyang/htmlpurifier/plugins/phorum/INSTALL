    How to install the Phorum HTML Purifier plugin

0. PREREQUISITES
----------------
This Phorum module only works on PHP5 and with HTML Purifier 4.0.0
or later.

1. UNZIP
--------
Unzip phorum-htmlpurifier-x.y.z, producing an htmlpurifier folder.
You've already done this step if you're reading this!

2. MOVE
-------
Move the htmlpurifier folder to the mods/ folder of your Phorum
installation, so the directory structure looks like:

phorum/
    mods/
        htmlpurifier/
            INSTALL - this install file
            info.txt, ... - the module files
            htmlpurifier/

3. INSTALL HTML PURIFIER
------------------------
Download and unzip HTML Purifier <htmlpurifier.org>. Place the contents of
the library/ folder in the htmlpurifier/htmlpurifier folder. Your directory
structure will look like:

phorum/
    mods/
        htmlpurifier/
            htmlpurifier/
                HTMLPurifier.auto.php
                ... - other files
                HTMLPurifier/

Advanced users:
    If you have HTML Purifier installed elsewhere on your server,
    all you need is an HTMLPurifier.auto.php file in the library folder which
    includes the HTMLPurifier.auto.php file in your install.

4. MIGRATE
----------
If you're setting up a new Phorum installation, all you need to do is create
a blank migrate.php file in the htmlpurifier module folder (NOT the library
folder.

If you have an old Phorum installation and was using BBCode,
copy migrate.bbcode.php to migrate.php. If you were using a different input
format, follow the instructions in migrate.bbcode.php to create your own custom
migrate.php file.

Your directory structure should now look like this:

phorum/
    mods/
        htmlpurifier/
            migrate.php

5. ENABLE
---------
Navigate to your Phorum admin panel at http://example.com/phorum/admin.php,
click on Global Settings > Modules, scroll to "HTML Purifier Phorum Mod" and
turn it On.

6. MIGRATE SIGNATURES
---------------------
If you're setting up a new Phorum installation, skip this step.

If you allowed your users to make signatures, navigate to the module settings
page of HTML Purifier (Global Settings > Modules > HTML Purifier Phorum Mod >
Configure), type in "yes" in the "Confirm" box, and press "Migrate."

ONLY DO THIS ONCE! BE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR DATABASE!

7. CONFIGURE
------------
Configure using Edit settings. See that page for more information.

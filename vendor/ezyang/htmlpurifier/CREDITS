Almost everything written by Edward Z. Yang (Ambush Commander).  Lots of thanks
to the DevNetwork Community for their help (see docs/ref-devnetwork.html for
more details), Feyd especially (namely IPv6 and optimization).  Thanks to RSnake
for letting me package his fantastic XSS cheatsheet for a smoketest.

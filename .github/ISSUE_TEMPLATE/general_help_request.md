* If you have some error the first thing you should do is to check **Manage » Logs » App Logs**!!! If there are any errors there - make sure to provide them in the issue.
* Have you read FAQ? https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/wiki/FAQ
* If you have "Whoops something went wrong" error see: https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/wiki/Installation-Guide#11-troubleshooting
* Feature requests for modules should be posted here: https://freescout.net/request-feature/
* Docker questions should go here: https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-freescout/issues
* Create separate issues for different topics - no need to mix all your problems into one issue.
* Questions on issues with payments for modules should be sent by email: https://freescout.net/contact-us/
* Mentioning how much you've spent on modules is the way to being banned.

Still here? Well clean this out and go ahead :)
